// https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher/submissions/

// Figured it out by identifying the pattern.
// The number of bulbs that are on increase at n = (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 ...)
// That's a series generated by f(x) =  2*f(x - 1) - f(x - 2) + 2
// Where f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1

// Turns out, the answer is always just the square root of n (duh, the pattern is perfect squares)
